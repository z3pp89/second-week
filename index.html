          <h5>JavaScript</h5>
            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
              It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional program. To find out more about JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript">click here</a>.</p>

          <h5>C#</h5>
            <p>C# is an elegant and type-safe object-oriented language that enables developers to build a variety of secure and robust applications that run on the .NET Framework.
              You can use C# to create Windows client applications, XML Web services, distributed components, client-server applications, database applications, and much, much more.
