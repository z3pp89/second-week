            <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
              It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional program. To find out more about JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript">click here</a>.</p>
